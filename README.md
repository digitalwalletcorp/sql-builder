# sql-builder
Inspired by Java's S2Dao, this JavaScript library dynamically generates SQL. It embeds entity objects into SQL templates, simplifying complex query construction, enhancing readability. Ideal for flexible, type-safe SQL generation without a full ORM. Efficiently handles dynamic WHERE clauses, INSERTs, and UPDATEs, reducing boilerplate code.
